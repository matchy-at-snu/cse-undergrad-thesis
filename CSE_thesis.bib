  abstract = {Two kinds of contemporary developments in cryptography are examined. Widening applications of teleprocessing have given rise to a need for new types of cryptographic systems, which minimize the need for secure key distribution channels and supply the equivalent of a written signature. This paper suggests ways to solve these currently open problems. It also discusses how the theories of communication and computation are beginning to provide the tools to solve cryptographic problems of long standing.},

  abstract = {We describe an implementation of a distributed algorithm to generate a shared RSA key. At the end of the computation, an RSA modulus N = pq is publicly known. All servers involved in the computation are convinced that N is a product of two large primes, however none of them know the factorization of N . In addition, a public encryption exponentispublicly known and each server holds a share of the private exponent. Such a sharing of an RSA key has many applications and can be used to secure sensitive private keys. Previously, the only known method to generate a shared RSA key was through a trusted dealer. Our implementation demonstrates the e\#ectiveness of shared RSA key generation, eliminating the need for a trusted dealer. 1 Introduction To protect an RSA private key, one may break it into a number of pieces \#shares\# and store each piece at a separate location. Sensitive private keys, such as Certi\#cation Authority \#CA\# keys, can be protected in this way. Fortunately, for the RSA cr...},

  abstract  = {The author investigates the following problem: Suppose m people wish to compute the value of a function f(x1, x2, x3, ..., xm), which is an integer-valued function of m integer variables xi of bounded range. Assume initially person Pi knows the value of xi and no other x's. Is it possible for them to compute the value of f, by communicating among themselves, without unduly giving away any information about the values of their own variables? The author gives a precise formulation of this general problem and describe three ways of solving it by use of one-way functions (i.e., functions which are easy to evaluate but hard to invert). These results have applications to secret voting, private querying of database, oblivious negotiation, playing mental poker, etc.. He also discusses the complexity question "How many bits need to be exchanged for the computation," and describes methods to prevent participants from cheating. Finally, he studies the question "What cannot be accomplished with one-way functions."},
