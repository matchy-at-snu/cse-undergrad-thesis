\chapter{Results}

During testing, the cluster can generate a public key and corresponding distributed private keys correctly and efficiently. The generated public key can be printed in correct format and the information can be parsed correctly using 3rd party key parser. A message can be encrypted by the manager using the implemented encryption algorithm, and the encrypted message can be correctly decrypted by the workers using the distributed private keys.
