\section{Secure Multiparty Computing (MPC)}

Secure Multiparty Computing (MPC) is a way of enabling a group of data owners to jointly compute a function using all their data as inputs, without disclosing any participant's private input to each other or any third party \cite{evans2018pragmatic}. This idea was first introduced in Yao's discussion on the famous Yao's millionaire problem in the early 1980s \cite{yao1982protocols}. He also raised the first MPC protocol: the Garbled Circuits Protocol \cite{yao1982protocols}, which remains the basis for many current MPC implementations. From then on, various MPC protocols have been proposed.
