\begin{abstract}
Secure Multiparty Computing (MPC) is a heated research field in cryptography with the goal of creating methods for multiple parties to jointly contribute to the computation while keeping the input private to each party. Rives-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption algorithm, which requires lots of computations involving multiplication and modulo on large prime numbers, is suitable to be modified to work in an MPC scenario. However, there is almost no existing implementation for distributed RSA keypair generation, and their usage is also limited by the complicated configuration.\par
Here we present a modern containerized MPC module for RSA keypair generation and decryption. It implements the classic Ben-Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson (BGW) protocol in a highly parallel manner using \texttt{gRPC}, a high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework. The implementation achieved the goal of eliminating the need for trusted dealer in secret sharing and successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of shared RSA key generation. With the sieving method and several pruning techniques applied, it also showed sufficiently high performance, which is about 50 times faster than the traditional single-threaded scheme.\par
% The MPC RSA module is freely open source at \href{https://github.com/matchy233/mpc-rsa}{\textit{https://github.com/matchy233/mpc-rsa}}.
